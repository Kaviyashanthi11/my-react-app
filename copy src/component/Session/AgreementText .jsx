        the electronic form and format requested by the individual, if it is
        readily producible, or, if not, in a readable electronic form and format

        unauthorized access, use or disclosure of electronic PHI; and (ii)
        incidents involving the incidental access to, or minimal encounter, with
        PHI provided that the recipient would not reasonable by able to retain
        such PHI and the incident does not pose a significant risk of harm to
        the individual who is the subject of the PHI, as reasonably determined
        by Associate. All reports of Breaches shall be made in compliance with
